            Welcome to C.P.V's horror page , here I prepared a small database of
            my favorite antagonists from different horror films. I myself am not
            sure for the reason of why I love horror movies so much but there's
            a certain thrill about being scared to a certain degree, it gets my heart pounding and my
            pulses racing ,well when it pertains to horror movies that is , I understand 
            not everyone is going to find this page appealing. My responce 
            to that is "WHAT THAT GOTTA DO WITH ME !!"{" "}
